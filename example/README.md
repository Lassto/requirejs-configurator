# Example

This demos how configuration generated by *requirejs-configurator* can be consumed by an AMD/CJS loader. In this case we want to load some CJS modules therefore we're using Cajon. If your project is using npm with your own AMD modules, you could use Require.js as the loader.

*requirejs-configurator* is not intended as the best workflow in terms of web app development (check out webpack, browserify, Rave.js). It's more of a building block for other tools. It's quite a specialised package so to speak. It supports `npm`'s package layout out of the box so it could prove to be useful for simple Require.js/Cajon based projects.

Here we load a bunch of modules from npm, some of which have nested deps. As you can see in the source code, we don't need to manually configure any of them - *requirejs-configurator* generates all required path and package configuration.

# Running the example

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:8000
```

To regenerate the config (if you install new npm deps) run

```
npm rc
```

which simply executes

```
requirejs-configurator --npm > config.js
```
