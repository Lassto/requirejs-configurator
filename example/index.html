  <p>This demos how configuration generated by <i>requirejs-configurator</i> can be consumed by an AMD/CJS loader. In this case we want to load some CJS modules therefore we're using Cajon. If your project is using npm with your own AMD modules, you could use Require.js as the loader.</p>

  <p><i>requirejs-configurator</i> is not intended as the best workflow in terms of web app development - I'd suggest webpack, browserify, Rave.js or jspm for that. <i>requirejs-configurator</i> is just a tool for generating config for require.js which can be useful in certain situations.</p>

  <p>Here we load a bunch of modules from npm, some of which have nested deps. As you can see in the source code, we don't need to manually configure any of them - <i>requirejs-configurator</i> generates all required path and package configuration.</p>
